# Attached is my final project from my CS class taken in the fall of 2018.

# This file contains three functions; prepare_words(in_string),
# word_to_base4(new_string), and base10_to_words(num). First, it takes an
# input of in_string, which is a string,  and runs it through
# prepare_words(in_string) and word_to_base4(new_string) in that order
# to convert the string into a base 4 number using the given code words. It
# then prints the equivalent base 4 number into the string. Secondly, it takes
# an input of num, which is a non negative integer, and runs it through
# base10_to_words(num) to convert it from base 10 notation into its
# corresponding code words and prints them.

    # to be a string. It is then run through prepare_words and words_to_base4

    # to_base4.

    # integer and then the exception handling takes care of anything from

    # user for a non-negative integer until the user's input meets those
    # requirements.
